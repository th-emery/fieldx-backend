## Development server

Before starting the server, run the following command to install the packaged:

```bash
npm install
```

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once the server is running, the server can be reached at `http://localhost:3000/`. The server will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
